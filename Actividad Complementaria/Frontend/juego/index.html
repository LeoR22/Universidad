                <p class="rules-details">A Movies Game is based on Google's ability to correctly identify a movie when
                        given a very vague plot summary.</p>
                <p class="rules-details">The aim is simple: without using any actor, director or character names, or
                        words from the title, can you make a Google search that results in a movie's IMDB or Wikipedia
                        page as the first result? How many words do you need? Can you do it in five words? Three?</p>
                <p class="rules-details">For example, you might get the movie Inception*. If you type "stealing dreams
                        movie" in the search box, you've made a three word guess. Press the button or hit enter to find
                        out if you're correct**. If you're not, try again. If you are, try another with fewer words, or
                        get a new movie and play again.
                <p class="rules-details">That's pretty much it. Feel free to reach out with comments, bugs, requests, or
                        anything else.</p>
                <p class="rules-details">*the movie is picked randomly from a subset of IMDB's 1000 top rated movies</p>
                <p class="rules-details">**You won't be, by the way. That query comes up with the 1995 movie The City Of
                        Lost Children. "Stealing dreams top movie" is a winner though, as is "dreams extraction movie".
